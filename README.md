Bonanza1000 slot clone with working logic and a pinch of magic 🎲
KAZIK is a fan implementation of a slot machine in the spirit of Bonanza1000, but without investments, losses and credit debts.
The project demonstrates how you can recreate a slot machine from scratch: with spin mechanics, match logic and simple animations.

🔧 Technical features:
Pure JavaScript game engine — no magic, just Math.random() and a little pain

CSS animations — the reels spin like in the real thing (almost)

Code structure — modular and minimalistic (size — like a supermarket receipt)

No dependencies — everything is written by hand, like in the good old 2010s

🤹‍♂️ Who is it for:
For those who want to understand how slots work from the inside (without a casino)

For developers who lack excitement in life

For students who want to play and say: "This is a school project!"

⚠️ Disclaimer:
This project was created for educational and entertainment purposes.
No real gambling, bets, withdrawals and regulators from Las Vegas.
